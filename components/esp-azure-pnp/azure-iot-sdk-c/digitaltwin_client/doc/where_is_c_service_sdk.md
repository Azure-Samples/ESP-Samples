# Where is the Digital Twin Service SDK for C?

There is no C implementation of the Digital Twin Service SDK. 

Service SDKs -  SDK's used by service operators and server side application developers - almost always run in environments with substantially more resources than embedded devices that C targets.  They are available from other languages, however.
